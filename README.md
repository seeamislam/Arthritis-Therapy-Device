##### A therapeutic device engineered to relieve Gout patients of their discomfort. 

## Problem

Gout is a type of arthritis which strikes millions of victims across the world. Patients generally suffer from intense swelling and inflammation within the MTP joint of their foot. This ultimately causes the victim to experience extensive pain and discomfort. 
Unfortunately, there is no definite cure for gout, however the effects can be treated using therapeutic technology. 

## Design Metrics

This therapeutic device is designed to alleviate the swollen joint using ammonium nitrate gel packs. Most importantly, the condition of the device can be monitored by the user to ensure continuous relief. 

- The temperature of the gel is measured using sensors which are integrated within the device. 
- If the ice is below melting point, a green LED will turn on (signalling that the gel has not melted). 
- If it is above melting point, a red LED will turn on (signalling that the gel has melted).
- The temperature is transmitted to the user's phone using Bluetooth connectivity, which can be viewed using an Android application, known as Ardudroid.
